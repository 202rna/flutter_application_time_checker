# Application for iOS, Android and Windows.

  This is the cross-platform application for saving timings :floppy_disk:. Builds graphs, helps to track the dynamics of progress.
The main idea of the app is to help the coach keep track of people's statistics not in a journal, but on his phone :iphone: , so as not to be distracted once again. And then, if necessary, write notes in writing in a notebook. As it is, this application can be used by anyone who finds it useful for themselves.

## Time Juornal - Журнал времени
The application consists of three main components:
- **MAIN GROUPS** - The main screen is a list of people (for coaches) or different disciplines or something else...
- **SUBGROUPS** - Each main group (discipline, person...) can contain many subgroups (for example, :running: RUNNING -> 100m, 200m, 1km)
- **LIST** of stopwatch time cutoff - Each of the subgroups contains fixed time intervals. This is the time that the stopwatch showed and needs to be saved.
- For all timings, you can create a graph to show progress. (again for example, RUNNING -> 100m -> :checkered_flag: 00:14:23, 00:12:44 etc
#### Below are some screenshots of the application
